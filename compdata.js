                <h2>Eligibility Criteria </h2>
                <br />
                To be eligible for the Adobe recruitment process, the candidates must fulfill the
                following criteria. <br />
                <i>

                <h2>Recruitment Process:Overview of the rounds</h2>
                <br />
                The hiring process at Adobe's complete recruitment process can be divided into the
                following categories:
                <br />
                <i>• Online Written Round<br />
                    • Technical Interview Rounds<br />
                    • HR Interview Rounds<br /></i>
                <br />
                The above rounds may be preceded by an introductory phone interview (especially if
                you have applied through an online application). This helps the hiring manager to learn
                more about the candidate and answer any questions that they may have about the role
                or Adobe in general before heading with the crucial rounds. The details of the above
                rounds are as follows:

                <h3>Online Written Round::</h3>
                <br />
                The online round is the most critical stage of the Adobe
                recruitment process. It consists of an aptitude test, a technical assessment, and a
                coding assessment. The entire round lasts for about 2.5 hours. Sometimes this may be
                followed by a gamified assessment and a group discussion round. There is no negative
                marking in these tests and the shortlisted candidates enter the subsequent personal
                interview rounds of the selection process
                <br />
                <br />
                <h3>Technical Interview Rounds:</h3>
                <br />
                The Adobe recruitment process has multiple technical
                interview rounds to check the conceptual knowledge and coding skills of the
                candidates. In these rounds, the candidates may face questions related to computer
                science fundamentals such as operating systems, DBMS, Dynamic Programming,
                memory management, etc. They may also be asked questions related to the projects
                done in the past. The level of difficulty of the questions ranges from medium to hard.

                <br />
                <h3>HR Interview Round:</h3>
                <br />
                This is the final round in the Adobe recruitment process. In

                opportunity to ask questions from the interviewer regarding the company culture,
